# Predictive Insights into Game Outcomes: An Examination of Match Results through Poisson Regression Techniques

## Overview

This paper introduces a comprehensive approach to forecasting game outcomes by employing Poisson regression models. The research systematically analyzes various types of match results from multiple games, aiming to uncover underlying patterns and trends that contribute to the predictability of game outcomes. By integrating statistical methods and machine learning techniques, the study offers a novel perspective on predictive modeling within the context of competitive games. The paper not only demonstrates the efficacy of Poisson regression in understanding and predicting match results but also provides a detailed methodology that can be applied to a wide range of games. This research is invaluable for analysts, game theorists, and enthusiasts interested in the quantitative aspects of game outcomes and betting strategies.
