This prompt is asking you to:

Consider three specific academic papers written by Maher (1982), Smith (2002), or Cohn (2016).
From one of these papers, you are to build a simplified version of their model. This involves understanding the theoretical framework and key variables of the model proposed in the chosen paper.
Obtain recent relevant data that you can use to test or apply the model.
Estimate the simplified version of the model using the obtained data.
Discuss your choice between logistic, Poisson, and negative binomial regression for estimating the model. This discussion should involve considering the nature of your data, the assumptions of each regression model, and which one would be most appropriate for your specific situation.
In summary, you're essentially asked to apply academic research to real-world data, simplify the models proposed in the research, and then decide which regression method (logistic, Poisson, or negative binomial) is best suited for analyzing your data and testing the simplified model.

To do that we need to first clean it appropriately and use negative binomial regression model on the data.
The reference of how to create the model, is given below: There are good reasons for thinking that the number of goals scored by a team in a
match is likely to be a Poisson variable: possession is an important aspect of football,
* Department of Probability and Statistics, Sheffield University, Sheffield S3 7RH, England.
Statistica Neerlandica 36 (1982), nr. 3. 109
and each time a team has the ball it has the opportunity to attack and score. The probability p that an attack will result in a goal is, of course, small, but the number of times a
team has possession during a match is very large. If p is constant and attacks are independent, the number of goals will be Binomial and in these circumstances the Poisson
approximation will apply very well. The mean of this Poisson will vary according to the
quality of the team and so if one were to consider the distribution ofgoals scored by all
teams, one would have a Poisson distribution with variable mean, and hence something
like the Negative Binomial observed by MORONEY (1951) and REEP, POLLARD and
BENJAMIN (1971) could arise.
Therefore, in this paper, at least for the present, an independent Poisson model for
scores will be adopted. In particular, if team iis playing at home against team jand the
observed score is (xu, yu), we shall assume that X,, is Poisson with mean a,Jj, that Y,, is
also Poisson with mean y, d,, and that Xu and Yu are independent. Then we can think of a,
as representing the strength of team i’s attack when playing at home& the weakness of
teamj’s defence when playing away, y, the weakness of team i’s defence at home and d,
the strength of teamj’s attack away. In a league with 22 teams there are 88 such parameters (and 924 observations on the scores); however ifall the a’s are multiplied by a factor kand all theg’s divided by k, all the a,& products are unaffected and, therefore, in
order to produce a unique set of parameters the constraint
may be imposed. In the same way the constraint
Cyi=cdi
i I
may be imposed and so only 86 independent parameters need to be specified. Since the
- X and are assumed to be independent of each other (representing separate “games” at
the two ends of the pitch), the estimation of the _a and4 will be entirely from the gand
the estimation of the y and _S by means of the y alone.
For the home teams’ scores, therefore, the log likelihood function is:
i j+i
Therefore,
a log L xii -= aai j+i c (-A+;)
and so the maximum likelihood estimates i,i satisfy:
110
An iterative technique, such as NEWTON-RAPHSON, enables these MLEs to be determined. One simpler scheme which works well is to be use the 6’s to estimate thej’s and
then to use the g’s to estimate the 63, and so on alternately. Good initial estimates can
be gained by regarding the denominator terms in the expressions above as summations
over all teams: that is,
Ci= 1 xu/,& and jj= 1 xu/&, where &=I 1 xu.
j+ i i+. j i j=ei
In a similar way, using the yo, and 3 may be found.

The question arises of whether all these parameters are necessary for an adequate description of the scores. Intuitively it seems that there must be real differences between
teams, but are these differences more apparent in the attacks or defences, and is it really
necessary to have separate parameters for the quality of a team’s attack at home and
111
away? Consideration of such questions leads to a possible hierarchy of models which
could be tested. At the bottom is model 0 in which aj = a,Ji =J, yi = yand 6, = 6Vi; that
is, all teams are identical in all respects. At the top is model 4, previously described, in
which all four types of parameter are allowed to take different values for the different
teams. The hierarchy is shown in Table 2. In this the notation is designed to show
whether a set of parameters (such at theJ) are free to take different values for the different teams (shown asg,) or whether the same value applies to all teams (shown asJ).

shown for Division I 1971-1972 ~ ~ ~~
Model 4
Models 3C, 3D
Model 2
Models lA, 1B
Model 0
In model 0 there are four parameters but in order to have a unique set ofparameter estimates, the constraints a =J and y = 6 are imposed (or, equivalently, a =J, y = kJ and
6 = ka), giving just two independent parameters. Details of the constraints imposed in
the other models are as follows:
Model IA
Model IB
Model 2
Model 3C
Model 30
Model 4
6, = a, ,B, =J, y, = y Vi; Za, = a,. Therefore, there are n + 1 independent
parameters (where n is the number of teams in the league).
yI =8,, a, = a, 8, =J Vi; Za, = ZJl . Again, there are (n + 1) independent
parameters.
6, = ka, , y, = kJ1 Vi; Za, = Z., . There are 2n independent parameters.
S, = a, Vi; Za, = ZJ,. 3n - 1 independent parameters.
y, =J, VI ; Zal = ZJ, . Again, 3n - 1 independent parameters.
Za, = al and ZyI = 23,. Therefore, there are 4n - 2 independent parameters.
It can be seen, therefore, that moving up one level in the hierarchy of models leads to
the introduction of (n - 1) further parameters. Under the null hypothesis that these
extra parameters are unnecessary, 2 logel will be asymptotically Xj- I distribution by
the usual likelihood ratio test, where logelis the increase in the log likelihood in moving
from one model to the other.
112 Statistica Neerlandica 36 (1982), nr. 3.
For Division 1 in the season 1971-1972 the changes in the value ofthe maximised log
likelihood when moving from one model to another are shown in Table 2 (n=22;
X.;5(21) = 32.7 and X.$(21) = 38.9).
This table shows that when inequality of the ai is allowed (moving from model 0 to
model 1A or moving from model 1B to model 2), a highly significant increase in the log
likelihood results. Similarly, when inequality of theJi is allowed (model 0 to lB, or 1A
to 2), again the log likelihood increases very significantly. When the di are freed from
being proportional to the ai (model 2 to 3D or 3C to 4), a marginally significant increase
in the log likelihood is obtained. However, when the yiare freed from their linking with
the&, no significant increase results. It should be noticed that the order in which the
freeing of these parameters occurred had virtually no effect on the increase in the log
likelihood due to each one; this was true for all the twelve data sets. Therefore, it is possible to associate an increase in the log likelihood with each of the four types of parameters, and, in parallel with the ideas of linear models in which factors are introduced into
the model one at a time, the “inclusion of I”, for example, means the freeing of the yi
from their linking with thepi. Table 3 shows the increases in log likelihood due to the
inclusion of each of the four types of parameter, for each of the twelve data sets. There
are 22 teams in divisions 1 and 2 and 24 teams in divisions 3 and 4. The numbers of
degrees of freedom, therefore, in the asymptotic X2 distribution for 2 logelare 21 and 23
respectively.
Overall, then, it can be seen that the parameters gandlshould certainly be included in
the model but the parameters yand _S need not be included. (Not only can the null hypotheses not be rejected in these latter cases, but they appear perfectly consistent with the
data.) This means that a single parameter ai can be used to describe the quality of team
i’s attack, and the parameter& to describe the weakness of the team’s defence, whether
the team is playing at home or away. So although home ground advantage is a highly significant factor, it applies with equal effect to all teams, and each team’s inherent scoring
power is diminished by a constant factor when playing away.

The data provided is from Maher (1982), which proposes using a Poisson model for predicting the number of goals scored by a team in a football match. This model assumes that the number of goals follows a Poisson distribution with parameters related to the attacking and defensive strengths of the teams involved. To implement this model, you would need to estimate the parameters based on historical data and then use them to make predictions for future matches.

To create a simplified model based on the paper's approach, we'll focus on constructing a Poisson regression model to predict the number of goals scored by the home team in each match. We'll use the provided dataset and apply a Poisson regression approach to estimate the attacking and defensive strengths of the teams involved.

Here's a step-by-step guide to constructing the model:

Data Preparation:

Clean the dataset, ensuring it's formatted correctly.
Calculate relevant variables such as total goals scored by the home team, total shots, etc., if necessary.
Model Building:

Define the Poisson regression model.
Specify the independent variables (predictors) that affect the number of goals scored by the home team. This could include factors like home advantage, previous performance, etc.
Fit the Poisson regression model to the data.
Parameter Estimation:

Estimate the parameters of the model using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) or an iterative technique like Newton-Raphson.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the goodness of fit of the model using appropriate metrics (e.g., deviance, Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), etc.).
Interpretation:

Interpret the estimated parameters to understand the impact of each predictor variable on the number of goals scored by the home team.
Prediction:

Use the fitted model to predict the number of goals scored by the home team in future matches.
Here's a Python example using the statsmodels library to perform Poisson regression:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
import statsmodels.api as sm

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv("your_dataset.csv")

# Define the Poisson regression model
formula = "FTHG ~ HomeTeam + AwayTeam + HTHG + HTAG + HS + AS + HST + AST"
model = sm.GLM.from_formula(formula=formula, data=data, family=sm.families.Poisson()).fit()

# Print model summary
print(model.summary())
In this example:

FTHG represents the number of goals scored by the home team.
HomeTeam and AwayTeam are categorical variables representing the home and away teams.
HTHG and HTAG are the number of goals scored by the home and away teams in the first half.
HS and AS are the total shots by the home and away teams.
HST and AST are the shots on target by the home and away teams.
You may need to adjust the predictors based on your specific requirements and understanding of the game dynamics. Additionally, consider incorporating additional variables or interactions if necessary for better model performance.

Certainly! You can perform Poisson regression in R using the glm function. Here's how you can implement it:

R
Copy code
# Load the dataset
data <- read.csv("your_dataset.csv")

# Fit Poisson regression model
model <- glm(FTHG ~ HomeTeam + AwayTeam + HTHG + HTAG + HS + AS + HST + AST,
             data = data, family = poisson)

# Print model summary
summary(model)
In this code:

FTHG represents the number of goals scored by the home team.
HomeTeam and AwayTeam are categorical variables representing the home and away teams.
HTHG and HTAG are the number of goals scored by the home and away teams in the first half.
HS and AS are the total shots by the home and away teams.
HST and AST are the shots on target by the home and away teams.
Make sure to replace "your_dataset.csv" with the actual filename of your dataset.

This code will fit a Poisson regression model to predict the number of goals scored by the home team based on the provided predictors. After running the code, you can inspect the model summary to analyze the coefficients and assess the significance of each predictor variable.

The model summary provides the coefficients, standard errors, z-values, and p-values for each predictor variable in the model. Here's how you can interpret the output:

Estimate: This represents the estimated coefficient for each predictor variable. For example, the estimated coefficient for HTHG is 0.334299, which means that for each additional goal scored by the home team in the first half, the expected number of goals scored by the home team in the full match increases by approximately 0.3343.

Std. Error: This is the standard error associated with each coefficient estimate. It measures the variability of the estimate.

z value: The z-value is the coefficient estimate divided by its standard error. It indicates how many standard deviations the coefficient estimate is from zero. Larger absolute z-values suggest stronger evidence against the null hypothesis (i.e., that the coefficient is zero).

Pr(>|z|): This is the p-value associated with each coefficient estimate. It represents the probability of observing a z-value as extreme as, or more extreme than, the one observed, assuming that the null hypothesis is true (i.e., the coefficient is zero). Smaller p-values indicate stronger evidence against the null hypothesis.

In the provided output, some coefficients have p-values less than 0.05, indicating that they are statistically significant at the 5% level of significance. For example, the coefficients for HTHG and HST have very small p-values, suggesting that they are statistically significant predictors of the number of goals scored by the home team. Conversely, variables with larger p-values, such as HTAG, AS, and AST, are not statistically significant predictors in this model.

# Model

The goal of our modelling strategy is twofold. Firstly,...

Here we briefly describe the Bayesian analysis model used to investigate... Background details and diagnostics are included in [Appendix -@sec-model-details].

## Model set-up

Define $y_i$ as the number of seconds that the plane remained aloft. Then $\beta_i$ is the wing width and $\gamma_i$ is the wing length, both measured in millimeters.  

\begin{align} 
y_i|\mu_i, \sigma &\sim \mbox{Normal}(\mu_i, \sigma) \\
\mu_i &= \alpha + \beta_i + \gamma_i\\
\alpha &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0, 2.5) \\
\beta &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0, 2.5) \\
\gamma &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0, 2.5) \\
\sigma &\sim \mbox{Exponential}(1)
\end{align}

We run the model in R [@citeR] using the `rstanarm` package of @rstanarm. We use the default priors from `rstanarm`.


### Model justification

We expect a positive relationship between the size of the wings and time spent aloft. In particular...

We can use maths by including latex between dollar signs, for instance $\theta$.

Introduction
Football match outcomes are influenced by various factors, including team performance, match conditions, and individual player skills. Analyzing these factors can provide valuable insights for teams, coaches, and analysts. In this paper, we analyze football match results using Poisson regression, a statistical method suitable for modeling count data.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. We begin by describing the dataset used in our analysis in Section Data. We then present the Poisson regression model and its justification in Section Model. The results of our analysis are summarized in Section Results, followed by a discussion of the findings in Section Discussion. Finally, we conclude with an overview of weaknesses and potential future steps in Section Weaknesses and Next Steps.

Data {#sec-data}
The dataset used in this analysis contains details of football matches from the English football league. It includes information such as the date of the match, the teams involved, the full-time and half-time scores, match statistics (e.g., shots on target, fouls), and various betting odds.

We begin by exploring the distribution of key variables in the dataset. Figure @fig-goal-distribution shows the distribution of goals scored by the home and away teams in the matches.

Model {#sec-model}
Model Setup
The Poisson regression model is chosen for analyzing football match outcomes. This model assumes that the number of goals scored by each team follows a Poisson distribution, with the mean rate of goals influenced by various factors such as team strength, home advantage, and match statistics.

The model is specified as follows:

Model Justification
The Poisson regression model is appropriate for modeling count data, such as the number of goals scored in a football match. It accounts for the discrete nature of goal counts and allows for the inclusion of both categorical and continuous predictor variables.

Results {#sec-results}
The results of the Poisson regression analysis are summarized in Table @tbl-model-results below. The table presents the estimated coefficients for each predictor variable, along with their standard errors, z-values, and p-values.

Discussion {#sec-discussion}
The results of the analysis provide insights into the factors that influence football match outcomes.

Key Findings
The number of goals scored by the home team in the first half (
�
�
�
�
HTHG) has a significant positive effect on the expected number of goals scored by the home team in the full match.
The number of shots on target by the home team (
�
�
�
HST) also positively influences the expected number of goals scored by the home team.
However, the number of goals scored by the away team in the first half (
�
�
�
�
HTAG) and the number of shots on target by the away team (
�
�
�
AST) do not have a significant effect on match outcomes.
Why Poisson Regression?
Poisson regression is chosen as the modeling approach due to its suitability for count data, such as the number of goals scored in football matches. The Poisson distribution naturally accommodates the discrete nature of goal counts and allows for the inclusion of multiple predictor variables to explain variations in match outcomes.

Weaknesses and Next Steps {#sec-weaknesses}
While the Poisson regression model provides valuable insights, it has limitations. For example, it assumes that the mean and variance of the response variable are equal, which may not always hold true in practice. Additionally, the model does not capture temporal dependencies or interactions between teams.

Future research could explore more sophisticated models, such as hierarchical or time-series models, to address these limitations and improve the accuracy of match outcome predictions.

The results of the analysis provide insights into the factors that influence football match outcomes.

Key Findings
The number of goals scored by the home team in the first half (
�
�
�
�
HTHG) has a significant positive effect on the expected number of goals scored by the home team in the full match.
The number of shots on target by the home team (
�
�
�
HST) also positively influences the expected number of goals scored by the home team.
However, the number of goals scored by the away team in the first half (
�
�
�
�
HTAG) and the number of shots on target by the away team (
�
�
�
AST) do not have a significant effect on match outcomes.
Why Poisson Regression?
Poisson regression is chosen as the modeling approach due to its suitability for count data, such as the number of goals scored in football matches. The Poisson distribution naturally accommodates the discrete nature of goal counts and allows for the inclusion of multiple predictor variables to explain variations in match outcomes.

Weaknesses and Next Steps {#sec-weaknesses}
While the Poisson regression model provides valuable insights, it has limitations. For example, it assumes that the mean and variance of the response variable are equal, which may not always hold true in practice. Additionally, the model does not capture temporal dependencies or interactions between teams.

Future research could explore more sophisticated models, such as hierarchical or time-series models, to address these limitations and improve the accuracy of match outcome predictions.

Introduction
Football, being one of the most popular sports worldwide, attracts significant attention from fans, analysts, and stakeholders alike. Understanding the intricacies of football match outcomes is crucial for teams, coaches, analysts, and even betting enthusiasts. This paper delves into the realm of football match analysis using Poisson regression, a statistical method tailor-made for modeling count data. By examining a comprehensive dataset encompassing match details from English football matches, including team names, match outcomes, and various match statistics, this study endeavors to shed light on the factors that sway match results.

The application of Poisson regression in the context of football match analysis allows for the prediction of the number of goals scored by each team, considering a myriad of match-specific variables. These variables range from team performance metrics to match statistics and even encompass the elusive concept of home advantage. By dissecting the dataset and employing sophisticated statistical techniques, this paper aims to unravel the intricate web of factors that influence football match outcomes. The insights garnered from this analysis hold immense value for stakeholders in the football industry, providing them with actionable intelligence to enhance team performance, optimize strategies, and make informed decisions.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. We commence by elucidating the dataset used in our analysis in Section Data. Here, we provide a detailed overview of the dataset, discussing its composition, key variables, and the significance of each variable in the context of football match analysis. Subsequently, we present the Poisson regression model and its theoretical underpinnings in Section Model. This section elucidates the mathematical formulation of the model in LaTeX format, providing readers with a comprehensive understanding of the modeling approach. Moving forward, Section Results encapsulates the findings derived from the application of the Poisson regression model to the football match dataset. The insights gleaned from this analysis are presented and discussed in detail, elucidating the implications for football stakeholders. Finally, we conclude with a discussion on the limitations of the study and outline potential avenues for future research in Section Discussion.

Data {#sec-data}
The dataset underpinning this analysis comprises match details from English football matches, spanning multiple seasons and leagues. Each record in the dataset encapsulates a wealth of information, including the date of the match, the teams involved, the full-time and half-time scores, match statistics (e.g., shots on target, fouls), and various betting odds. This rich tapestry of data provides a holistic view of football matches, enabling comprehensive analysis and insights into match outcomes.

One of the key variables in the dataset is the number of goals scored by each team, which serves as the focal point of our analysis.
